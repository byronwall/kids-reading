I apologize for the oversight. In American English, the primary diphthongs usually include the ones already mentioned. However, the list of diphthongs can be expanded depending on the specificity of the dialect or the scope of the curriculum. Here's a more exhaustive table which also includes diphthongs that are perhaps less commonly emphasized but still present in English:

This list aims to be more comprehensive and should cover most of the diphthongs you might encounter in an American English-speaking context. Some of these may be considered triphthongs or more complex vowel sounds, but they are often simplified into diphthongs in many teaching settings.
